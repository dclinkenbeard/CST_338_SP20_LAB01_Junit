/**
 * The idea for this class is that it will represent a deck of
 * 52 playing cards. It needs: <br>
 *     <ul>
 *         <li> An array list to represent the cards in the deck</li>
 *         <li>a constructor (this will use loops to create the cards belonging to the 4 suits)</li>
 *         <li>a method to 'deal' n number of cards</li>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>Keep track of which cards are dealt. Either by setting a flag on the card (this will mean the Card object needs to change) or by creating a new arrayList</li>
 *         </ul>
 *         <li> a method to shuffle the deck.</li>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>Realistically this means just randomly selecting from the arrayList</li>
 *         </ul>
 * </ul>
